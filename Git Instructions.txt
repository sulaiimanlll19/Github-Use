First to clone/copy file from Github:
	- write this command -> "git clone <CloneURL> <fileName>"

To get the status of folder if uploaded or not:
	- write this command -> "git status" while accesing from bash

To get the unshipped file to be ready to push:
	- write this command -> "git add <fileName>

If identity unknown:
	- write these two command:
		-> git config --global user.email "<ur email>"
		-> git config --global user.name "<ur name>"

For first intial commit:
	- git commit -m "Initila commit"

Last command to push onto Github:
	- git push origin master/main

Ssssooo the following scenario commands for me:

	1. Creating || Modifying || Cloning file
	2. git status -> to figure which is modified od added
	3. git add <fileName>
	4. git commit -m "Describe type of edit"
	5. git push origin main
